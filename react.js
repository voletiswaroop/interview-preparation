Virtual dom?
-  Virtual DOM is just a copy/(virtual representation) of the original DOM kept in the memory and synced with the real DOM by libraries such as ReactDOM.
-  Virtual DOM has the same properties that of the Real DOM, but it lacks the power to directly change the content of the screen.
-  Every time the state of our application changes, the virtual DOM gets updated instead of the real DOM.

Why Virtual Dom is faster?
- A virtual DOM, which is a tree-shaped representation of the UI, is created by adding elements to it.
- Each element is a node on this tree. Every time one of these elements changes, a new virtual DOM tree is created.
- In the next step, the virtual DOM tree is compared with the previous virtual DOM tree.
- Once this is done, the virtual DOM calculates the best possible method to make these changes to the real DOM.
- This ensures that there are minimal operations on the real DOM. Hence, reducing the performance cost of updating the real DOM.

1. It updates slow.                        1. It updates faster.

2. Can directly update HTML.               2. Canâ€™t directly update HTML.

3. Creates a new DOM if element updates.   3. Updates the JSX if element updates.

4. DOM manipulation is very expensive.     4. DOM manipulation is very easy.
